WinLib is an object-oriented library for REALstudio and Xojo on Windows. It is constituted by the WinLib and Win32 module.

The Win32 module contains external methods, structures, constants, etc. that are found in the Win32 API. The Win32 module decouples declares from application code more cleanly than is commonly found in RB/Xojo projects that use them.

The WinLib module contains classes, methods, etc. which make use of the Win32 API via the Win32 module.
